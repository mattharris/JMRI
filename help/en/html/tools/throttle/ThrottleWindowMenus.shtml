<h1>Throttle Menus</h1>
<h2><a name="FileMenu">File menu</a></h2>

<img src="images/ThrottlesMenu3.png" alt="" ><br >
<h3>Load throttle</h3>

This menu entry allows to load a Throttle window layout into the curent
Throttle Window, it will load inner windows properties, and
Jynstruments if any.<br >

<h3>Save current throttle</h3>

This menu entry allows to save the current Throttle window layout, it
will save inner windows of the current throttle properties, and
Jynstruments if any.<br >
When a roster entry is selected, that menu entry is automatically
enabled, using it will create (or update) a default Throttle file for
that roster entry in &lt;JMRI Preferences Folder&gt;/throttle/XYZ.xml
where XYZ is the Roster ID.<br >
<br >
Note that when saving a Throttle that is the default one for a Roster
Entry, Function Buttons customization won't be saved in that file, they have to be
exported to the Roster Entry (in Edit menu, see bellow).<br >

<h3>Save current throttle as...</h3>

Allows to save the current Throttle window layout using any file name and path,
if this filename is not the default one for a Roster Entry, then,
Function Buttons customizations will be saved in that file.<br >

<h2><a name="EditMenu">Edit menu</a></h2>

<h3>Frame Properties</h3>

<img src="images/ThrottleWindowPreferences.png" alt="ThrottleWindowPreferences.png" >
<br >
Allows for editing current Throttle Window properties, particularly the
Window title:<br >

<ul>
  <li>Address - Automatically display the address of whatever locomotive is selected. This is the default.</li>
  <li>Text - Display the text that you enter in the field at the top of this window</li>
  <li>Text Address - Display the text you entered, followed by the selected address</li>
  <li>Address Text - Display the selected address, followed by the text you entered</li>
  <li>Roster ID - Display the selected roster ID</li>
</ul>

Note that if you enter text, it won't be visible unless one of the middle three modes is selected.<br >

<h3>Reset Function Buttons</h3>

Reset the function buttons content to default and reset their visibility.<br >
If a roster is selected, default button content will be loaded from roster entry; further more, if the matching preference is enabled, buttons undefined is the roster entry will be hidden.<br>

<h3>Export current throttles customization to roster</h3>

Push current throttle window customizations to the Roster particularly Function Buttons customizations. See <a href="RostersMediaPane.shtml" name="EditMenu">Roster Functions Labels Pane.</a>

<h2><a name="ViewMenu">View menu</a></h2>

<img src="images/ThrottlesMenu2.png" alt="" ><br >
The first part of the "<big>View</big>" menu displays a small menu of
							3 items &#8212; by default, each with a check mark preceding the item.  This
							corresponds to the 3 sub-windows (Address Panel, Function Panel, &amp; Control
							Panel) that are part of the throttle window.<br >
<p>As each
							sub-window has a minimize and close buttons, if one gets closed down in
							error, this menu option allows you to restore the window again.</p>

<p>Another way to use this option is when using the features of the throttles
							for decoders that are <u>not</u> associated with a motor (such as a lighted
							passenger car or caboose or a Fred unit).  In these cases, critical screen
							real estate can be saved by being able to disable (or close down) the
							Control Panel.  Be a little creative with the window resizing, and you
							could have several of these custom throttle windows in the same area as one
							single complete throttle window would take up.</a></p>

<h3>Show all function buttons</h3>
Note: this functionality was moved to "Reset Function Buttons" in the <a href="#EditMenu">"Edit" menu</a>

<h3>Get all current throttle components in bounds</h3>
<p>
Make sure that all inner windows of the current Throttle are inside the Throttle Window bounds.
